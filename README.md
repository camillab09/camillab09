- 👋 Hi, I’m Camilla!
-
- 👀 I’m interested in taking things apart, seeing how they work and learning how to make them work even better.
- Unfortunately I'm pretty clumsy, and power tools are not my friends. This is why coding is quickly becoming my favourite thing!
-
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. I'm starting pretty fresh, but currently putting most effort into JavaScript and C#. 
-
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easy and managable projects. I'm still learning and will need time and practice, but I hope to
- become a capable programmer in the future.
